Melanie Matyi is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center (FTDC)](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/), mentored by [Dr. Lauren Massimo](https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/live/profiles/15656-lauren-massimo) and [Dr. Corey McMillan](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/team-2/corey-mcmillan-phd). Her interests
are at the intersection of neuroimaging (e.g., fMIR, diffusion-weighted MRI), data science, and neuropsychiatric disorders. 

Her current research aims to understand how brain network connectivity contributes to the neuropsychiatric symptoms of bvFTD (a rare type of dementia). Her goal is to identify imaging-based biomarkers for bvFTD that allow early and accurate detection of disease progression and that can also help inform effective treatment. 

Melanie joined the FTD Center after completing her PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of Delaware in 2023. At Delaware, she conducted research focused on the neural mechanisms of emotion processes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior to graduate school, Melanie received a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh.
