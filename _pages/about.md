Melanie Matyi is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center (FTDC)](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/), mentored by [Dr. Lauren Massimo](https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/live/profiles/15656-lauren-massimo) and [Dr. Corey McMillan](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/team-2/corey-mcmillan-phd). Her interests
are at the intersection of neuroimaging (e.g., fMIR), data science, and neuropsychiatric disorders. 

Her current research aims to identify imaging-based biomarkers for disease monitoring and precision medicine with a particular focus on the neural mechanisms contributing to neuropsychiatric symptoms and executive dysfunction in behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration.

Melanie received her PhD in Clinical Science with a focus on neuroimaging methods from the University of Delaware in 2023. Prior to graduate school, she received a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh.
