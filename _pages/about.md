Melanie Matyi is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center (FTDC)](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/), mentored by [Dr. Lauren Massimo](https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/live/profiles/15656-lauren-massimo) and [Dr. Corey McMillan](https://www.pennftdcenter.org/team-2/corey-mcmillan-phd). Her research integrates advanced neuroimaging (e.g., functional MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, magnetic resonance elastography) and data science methods to investigate complex neuropsychiatric disorders.

Her current work investigates how brain network connectivity contributes to the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD), a rare neurodegenerative disease. The goal of this work is to identify imaging-based biomarkers for bvFTD, enabling earlier, more accurate detection of disease progression and helping to inform effective treatments.

Melanie joined the FTD Center after completing her PhD in Clinical Psychology at the University of Delaware in 2023. At Delaware, she conducted research focused on the neural mechanisms of emotion processes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior to graduate school, Melanie received a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh.


### My work at a high level

- Mapping the brain's "wiring": I use advanced brain imaging (like MRI) and network analysis to map the structural and functional connections between brain regions. This helps reveal how the brain is organized to support complex functions like memory, emotion regulation, and decision-making.

- Understanding Brain-Behavior Links: I investigate how individual differences in these brain networks relate to behavior and risk for mental health conditions. This includes studying topics like anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

- Tracking Brain Development and Risk: I examine how brain networks mature from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood, and how factors like parental anxiety or genetics can influence brain development and future mental health outcomes.
