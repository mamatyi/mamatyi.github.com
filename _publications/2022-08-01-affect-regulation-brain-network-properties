title: "Affect Regulation-Related Emergent Brain Network Properties Differentiate Depressed Bipolar Disorder From Major Depression and Track Risk for Bipolar Disorder"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This paper examines brain connectivity during affect regulation, finding that emergent network properties (e.g., involving the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala) differ between BD and MDD and can track BD risk in depressed patients.'
