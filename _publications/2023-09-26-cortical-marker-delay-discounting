title: "Assessing the utility of a novel cortical marker of delay discounting (C-DD) in two independent samples of early adolescents: Links with externalizing pathology"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This study tested a novel cortical marker of delay discounting (C-DD) in two large adolescent samples, finding that the C-DD was positively related to delay discounting behavior. Furthermore, the C-DD was discriminately associated with externalizing (but not internalizing) symptoms, replicating previous adult findings and suggesting it may be a useful neuroanatomical marker for risk.'
