title: "Mapping brain mechanical property maturation from childhood to adulthood"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'This paper uses high-resolution MRE to understand brain mechanical properties across maturation (ages 5-35), finding that properties like stiffness and damping ratio change considerably, with differing trajectories for gray/white matter and neuroanatomical subregions.'
